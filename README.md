# CodSoft Python Programming Internship Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects developed as part of my internship at **CodSoft**. The internship focused on hands-on experience in Python programming by building real-world applications from scratch. Each project strengthened my understanding of core Python concepts, user interaction, and basic logic implementation.

## Projects Included

1. **To-Do List Application**  
   A command-line task manager that allows users to add, update, delete, and view tasks. Tasks are stored persistently in a local text file.

2. **Python Calculator**  
   A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

3. **Password Generator**  
   A random password generator that creates secure passwords of a user-defined length using a mix of letters, digits, and symbols.

4. **Rock Paper Scissors Game**  
   A classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user competes against the computer. The game tracks and displays scores until the user chooses to exit.

5. **Contact Book Application**  
   A console-based contact manager to add, search, update, and delete contacts. It demonstrates the use of lists and dictionaries in Python.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies
- Standard input/output operations
- File handling and basic data structures
